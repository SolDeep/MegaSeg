# MegaSeg
This repository is an example implementation MegaSeg: Streaming-based Semantic Segmentation for Megapixel Images

#### See [COCO-minitain example](https://github.com/SolDeep/MegaSeg/blob/main/minicoco_Exp.ipynb) for an example comparing losses between MegaSeg and conventional training of Unet.

# Requirements
  - CUDA 10.2+
  - PyTorch 1.12.1
  - torchvision
  - tqdm
  - numpy
  - pillow
  - matplotlib
